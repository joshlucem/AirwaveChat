# AirwaveChat - Main configuration file
#
# Frequency limits:
# The number of available frequencies is calculated as:
#   (max - min) / step + 1
# The maximum allowed is 100,000 frequencies. If you exceed this, only the first 100,000 will be used.
#
# Examples:
#   min: 0.1, max: 10.0, step: 0.1   -> 100 frequencies
#   min: 0.1, max: 100.0, step: 0.1   -> 1,000 frequencies
#   min: 0.1, max: 10,000.0, step: 0.1 -> 100,000 frequencies (limit)
#
# Adjust these values to set the allowed frequency range and step for radio chat.

frequency:
  # Minimum allowed frequency (inclusive)
  min: 0.1
  # Maximum allowed frequency (inclusive)
  max: 10.0
  # Step size for frequency selection (e.g., 0.1 means 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...)
  step: 0.1
